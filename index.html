      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was a legendary Indian poet, writer, philosopher, musician, and artist, widely regarded as one of the greatest literary figures in modern Indian history. Born in Kolkata into a culturally rich and progressive family, he began writing poetry at an early age and went on to produce an extraordinary body of work that includes poems, novels, short stories, essays, plays, and songs. In 1913, he became the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature for his English translation of Gitanjali (Song Offerings), a collection of deeply spiritual and philosophical poems. Tagore also wrote the national anthems of both India ("Jana Gana Mana") and Bangladesh ("Amar Shonar Bangla"), reflecting his profound influence on the cultural identity of the subcontinent. A passionate advocate for education, he founded Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan as a center for learning that blended Eastern and Western ideals. In addition to his literary achievements, he composed over 2,000 songs known as Rabindra Sangeet and developed a unique painting style in his later years. Tagore’s philosophy emphasized universal humanism, peace, individual freedom, and the harmony between humanity and nature, making him a timeless symbol of intellectual and spiritual thought across the world.
